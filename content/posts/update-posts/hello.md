‘Hello World!’

Now that I’ve gotten that taken care of, onward to other things.

I’m a Systems Admin working at OmnicomMediaGroup. Lately I’ve been working on a PowerShell module for API calls into our in house developed onboarding platform.
In my spare time, I’ve been working on a few Raspberry Pi projects to automate video uploads and transcoding into AWS buckets.

As I run across things that interest me, I’ll post about them.
