## Repairing my Sena 20S Evo: Battery Replacement & Right to Repair

When my Sena 20S Evo finally refused to power on, I realized I had to replace its battery. Sena didn't make the job easy. 5 small screws, a knob, and a gluded in battery made it a challenge.

I ordered a replacement battery from Amazon:

This video really helped me out:

## What You Need

- Small screw drivers and a pry tool or an iFixit tool kit that has everything you need.
- Replacement battery
- Patience and a steady hand

## Steps

1. Remove the five Phillips screws.
2. Remove the knob using a pry tool from the iFixit kit.
3. Take out the motherboard, carefully disconnecting its connectors (you may remove the water seal for extra clearance).
4. Pry out the old battery and disconnect it.
5. Connect the new 950 mAh replacement battery in place of the original.
6. Remove the internal ledge/tab (you may need to carefully break it off with needle‑nose pliers) so the motherboard fits correctly under the cover.
7. Reassemble everything: reinstall the motherboard, water seal, top cover, knob, and screws.

I did struggle with the water seal and getting the motherboard back into place.

> **Tip:** Get an iFixit tool kit.

## Why Right to Repair Matters

Sena could have made repalacing the battery easier. I don't have a need to replace my headset constantly.
