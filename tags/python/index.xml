&lt;p>No one wants to be the printer whisperer—especially for low-cost, unmanaged printers. After one too many toner emergencies (always at 4:59 PM on a Friday), I decided to automate the pain away. If you’re tired of being the “toner psychic,” this Python script is for you.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="why">Why?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Printers are needy, dramatic, and love to run out of toner at the worst possible moment. This project checks their status, logs the drama, and even emails you when it’s time to order more supplies. No more “surprise, you’re out of magenta!” moments.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
